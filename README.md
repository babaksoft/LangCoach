# Starting with one language (French)
This learning tool initially supports only the French language. It can be later enhanced to support several languages.

Because French grammar is very elaborated, I should think about supporting several important aspects; otherwise, my learning will become inefficient (or erratic). Some important aspects are :

- Usage context of each phrase (formal, friendly, familiar, etc.)
- Correct dictation (installing a French keyboard layout is mandatory) I'm more comfortable with Canadian keyboard layout, so that's what I'm going to install and use.
- Modern phrases, words and usage of French language (my learning materials are at least 10 years old and I need to be up-to-date)
- Word genders are very important in French, so I need a good way to put right emphasis on them.
- Conformance of male/female and plural/sigular forms are very important, so they need lots of practice to become natural.
